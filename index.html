            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, I'm Piyush Puru, a first year student at Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT-AP) University pursuing a Bachelor of Technology Degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE Core).</p>
            <p>I'm deeply passionate about coding and aspire to build a successful career in the tech industry. My journey in academia has been a blend of rigorous coursework and hands-on projects, where I've developed a strong foundation in programming languages like Python and Java, along with a knack for problem-solving and analytical thinking.</p>
            <p>I thrive on challenges and enjoy exploring new technologies to expand my skills and knowledge. My enthusiasm and creativity fuel my motivation to delve into innovative coding projects and contribute meaningfully to the ever-evolving tech landscape. I'm eager to continue learning, growing, and making impactful contributions in the exciting world of technology as well as make our lives easier with my applications.</p>

            <h2>My Experiences (Recent Projects)</h2>
            <div class="experience">
                <h3>Created a Bill Calculator</h3>
                <p>Using Python programming language, I made a bill calculator where it displays all the food items and their prices. After that, the user can enter the items they want to order, and it calculates the amount along with the tax. Finally, it displays the total amount the user has to pay.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="experience">
                <h3>Created a Guess the Number Game and Love Calculator</h3>
                <p>The system generates a random number between 1 to 100, and every time the user tries to guess it, they will get a response stating if their guess is too high or low. Easier said than done as it actually gets tough to guess! After five chances, BOOM! Game Over! Similarly, using a special formula, I recently created a love calculator game where the user is asked to input their as well as their partner's name, and it returns the percentage of how much their partner loves them. Again just a game and should only be taken seriously at your risk :) (Never take it seriously! Just a Game :P)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="experience">
                <h3>Created a Webpage- JOBXPERT</h3>
                <p>Recently, I took part in an event where we had to create a website for employees looking for job opportunities. So I created a webpage with my limited knowledge of HTML and CSS where one can enter their details and find appropriate jobs. There was also a feedback option! I did the frontend part of this!</p>
